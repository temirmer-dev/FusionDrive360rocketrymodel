# ðŸš€ Fusion Drive 360

Open-source prototype of a hybrid fusion-electric propulsion engine.  
Created as part of aerospace extracurricular research.

## Features
- Python scripts for thrust/Isp modeling
- CAD model of engine (FreeCAD)
- Graphs of performance trade-offs

## Example Results
- Reactor power: 50 MW
- Exhaust velocity: 30 km/s
- Thrust: ~15 N
- Isp: ~3,000 s

## Structure
- /src â†’ Python code
- /models â†’ CAD files
- /plots â†’ graphs
- /docs â†’ notes & papers

## Future Work
- Optimize Xe vs H2 propellants
- Extend model to variable power reactors
- Compare with NTR and Chemical
